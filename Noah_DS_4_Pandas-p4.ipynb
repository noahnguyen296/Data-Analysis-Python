    "#### Overview\n",
    "In some previous notebooks, we have `pd.to_numeric` that convert an input into numeric values. Here, `pd.to_datetime` converts the inputs into date and time data. Beside the parameter `errors =`, some of noteworthy arguments are:\n",
    "1. `dayfirst =  True/False`: this helps Pandas understand the input better, particular specifying that the input is in the structure beginning with day values. E.g. '05-05-2020'.\n",
    "2. `yearfist = True/False`: specifying that the input is in the structure beginning with year values. E.g. '2019-12-32'.\n",
    "3. `format = `: specifying the input structure, facilitating the understanding of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important to have the correct datetime format in many cases such as comparison operators between dates and times; numeric computations; filtering data by dates and times etc.**"
